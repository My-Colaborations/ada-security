# Introduction

Ada Security provides a security framework which allows applications to define
and enforce security policies. This framework allows users to authenticate by using
[OpenID Authentication 2.0](http://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-2_0.html)
as well as [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/2/) protocol.
It allows a web application to integrate easily with Yahoo!, Facebook and
Google+ authentication systems.
The Ada05 library includes:

  * An OpenID client authentication,
  * An OAuth 2.0 client authentication,
  * An OpenID Connect authentication framework,
  * An OAuth 2.0 server authentication framework,
  * A policy based security framework to protect the resources
