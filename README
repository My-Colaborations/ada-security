Ada Security Library

This Ada05 library provides some security frameworks needed by some Web applications.
It allows a web application to integrate easily with Google, Yahoo!, Facebook and
Google+ authentication systems.
The library includes:

 o An OpenID client authentication,
 o An OAuth 2.0 client authentication,
 o An OpenID Connect authentication framework,
 o A policy based security framework to protect the resources

To use Ada Security library, configure as follows:

   ./configure
   make

The unit tests are built and executed with:

   make test

For the installation, use the following command:

   make install

The package provides a simple AWS server that illustrates the OpenID and OpenConnect
authentication.  Build it as follows:

   gnatmake -Psamples

Before launching the demo server, you must update the 'samples.properties' file
and change the lines that contain PUT-HERE-YOUR-FACEBOOK-xxx and
PUT-HERE-GOOGLE-xxx with your client ID and client secrets.  These two changes
are required by the OAuth and OpenID Connect framework only.
Then, run the server:

   bin/auth_demo

and redirect your browser to:

   http://localhost:8080/atlas/login.html
